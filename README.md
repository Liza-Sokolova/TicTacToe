    - TicTacToeTest.cpp 
    
    - Makefile
        Contains the instructions to make and compile the files and objects. -- etc. 

## Coding Standards 

    - Naming conventions follow the format of descriptive variable and method names. 
        - Names are written with lowercase at the start and then uppercase with later words. (Ex: possibleVarible or thisIsMethod)
    - Comments before each method to describe input and output expected. 
    - Frequent comments to describe what parts of the code are intended to be doing. 
    - Header files and accompanying implementation files for objects and classes. 
    - Indents are 2 spaces. 
    - {} are meant to start at the same line as the statement they're attached to.
